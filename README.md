## Overview

<h3>How to play this game?</h3>
1. When the dice are rolled, the dice number is added to the current score.<br>
2. If the dice roll '1', the current score will be 0 and the game will pass to the other player.<br>
3. In order to keep the current score, the player should click the 'hold button'. Thus, the current score is transferred to the overall score.<br>
4. However, the game passes to the other player when the 'hold button' is clicked.<br>
5. Whoever first collects 100 points in total wins the game.<br>
